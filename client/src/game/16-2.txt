Seconds after the Antarcs were skyborne, the shock waves of the eruption traveled hundreds of miles... slamming like a gigantic hand against the atomic sub as it cruised in shallow water!
FRAME	-410	-200	1.20
Only an alloy steel hull could have withstood the shock! As the vessel lurched back to an even keel, Bill Tyler peered at the radar detectors...
Bill... what was it?	140	10	120	100
I've picked up blips showing fast-moving aircraft heading in this direction! Champ... we're going up for a look around!	400	30	150	100
FRAME	-750	-250	1.20
The instant the sub broke the surface, the atomic commandos knew what they were up against... a foe quick to attack... with weapons unlike any the world had ever known!
Hey! Those cannon ... they're firing some weird kind of electric bolt!	350	50	150	100
If they ever hit the engine room...	620	20	100	100
Our atomic reactors are finished! Quick, let's get this deck gun working!	550	230	180	100

Then, the sky split under a hail of bullet shells!
Right in the middle of their formation, Champ! That ought to do it!	100	10	200	100

It was a barrage that could have wiped out a good-sized city... but when the haze of combat lifted...
Huh? Am I dreaming? We only damaged one of those things... and the others are speeding off without a scratch!	30	10	270	100
FRAME	-30	-1620	1.20
In a screeching dive, the damaged sphere headed straight for the sub... and missed by a matter of inches!
Jeepers! Those guys inside are still looking for a fight! And I bet they get one!	60	10	200	100
FRAME	-750	-1620	1.20
Noiselessly, a hatch slid open, and now the atomic commandos were face to face with fighters from another civilization.
We have seen this diving boat many times on our gammascope! Seize it and destroy the crew!	350	10	300	100
