$connphrase Dr. Blake moved closed to you.

But I learned a lot from your missions, about what exercise can do for me. I wish I could be more brave and... live longer. You think I could if I do more exercise?	30	10	340	100

Dr. Blake was in a rush, but he vividly recalled some of his memories in a short moment.
I had a mentor a few years ago, Dr. Oppenheimer, a rather famous scientist. But we had some disagreements. I wish in a few years I'd be proven right. I wish I could live a long time to see this happen.	180	10	320	100
He thought atomic energy could be used to make humans more powerful, to make us a better species... such a naive idealist, I say! If the President kept listening to him, the atomic sub wouldn't exist, and America would be no more.	180	10	320	100
