That Bill Tyler knows what he's talking about, all right! In a pinch, give me the atomic commandos any time -- and the atomic sub!	70	20	180	100
Nuts! The U.S. army, navy and air corps can take care of any menace in the world -- and without the commandos, too!	290	150	150	100

Yes, there were many who thought this way ... who questioned the worth of the top level, all-powerful security force which Bill Tyler headed. But there were menaces out of this world, which conventional defense forces couldn't handle. 
Menaces like this, for instance, which, on December 17, roared from out of the crater of an extinct volcano in the lonely rockies.

That night, the skies held a strange, deadly menace ... speeding eastward, eastward! And there, unaware of the mighty challenge they would soon be called upon to meet, the atomic commandos busied themselves with routine tasks ...
This new atomic engine of mine should make the sub faster and more powerful. Matter of fact, I've got another in my workshop that's almost finished. That one may be even better than this!	360	10	320	100
Whoa Doc! One at a time! I want to see how this one works! Step her up -- all the way.	570	170	140	100

Up, up mounted the power ... to atomic heights never before attained! Further ... further ...

It was then that it came ... your first sight of the menace! A choked scream heralded its coming as it staggered into your midst ...
What the -- what is that thing? Where'd it come from?	660	10	150	100
