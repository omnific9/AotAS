As the atomic commandos reunited...
See what we did? Chased 'em from here to...	50	50	170	100
Stow it, Tony... what did we win? We still don't know who or what they are, or where they came from! All we know is that they've kidnapped America's Congress and we've got to find out where they're taking them!	450	10	300	100

There was only one device with the speed of the fleeing rockets... the specially-built plane which the atomic sub carried. With Bill at the controls and Champ at his side, it took off... hitting the perilous trail.

Mile after fleeing mile... and they closed in on their quarry!
We're getting 'em! That rocket in the center, the one the others are escorting... I'm betting that's the crate they've got our folks in!	40	100	600	100
Okay... then that's the one we don't shoot down! Let's go!	350	200	320	100

High in the stratosphere, a battle to the death! This was a plane of such speed and maneuverability as to dodge the fatal black rays! And as it hurtled through the skies, its deadly atomic bullets took an awful toll!

Now there was but one rocket remaining...
That's our baby... and it looks as if she's going down for a landing! We're over the rockies... but where she can go, we can go! Hold tight!	50	60	300	100

But the fleeing rocket wasn't heading for any regulation landing! Instead...
Holy Hannah, she's heading square into that crater... and I... I can't pull out of the dive!	40	60	220	100

And as Bill aimed his plane dead center for the crater, there came an awful quaking roar! The ancient volcano had erupted... catching them squarely in the fiery blast!
