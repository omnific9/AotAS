$connphrase Jonnie came to look at you playfully.
Ha... don't mind me, $sirormaam! I just heard about you from so many stories that I have to look at you, and see exactly how special you are. Even though we've been together a while, I still haven't really talked to you much!	120	20	480	100
What? Oh, I have an old buddy, a far relative of my family. I call him Old O. He was a great inventor an' he invented the telepathor too! Uh...	120	20	480	100

As Jonnie realized he just admitted to lying before, he blushed.
P... please don't tell Bill about it, or I'll get kicked out! Well... I didn't invent the telepathor. Old O invented it, and I took it, thinking I could use it to board the atomic sub.	220	5	370	100
An' I didn't care much about the sub, really. I just wanted to see you. Old O talked about you a lot, about how you were his last hope, and how your energy will lead us to victory.	220	5	370	100
See, it is true. When you accomplish your missions, I feel better too! An' I know Doc told me he'd invented all his little gadgets when you were doing a good job at your work. Sounds strange, but true!	220	5	370	100
