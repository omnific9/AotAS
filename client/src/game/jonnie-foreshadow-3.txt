$connphrase Jonnie looked outside the window of the atomic sub.
Don't you ever worry, $getusername? I mean don't you worry about Bill and everyone? Don't you worry about America, and what may turn us to dusts over night? I'm worried a lot.	220	2	380	100
I don't understand why you don't worry. Bill said you were someone completely different. Maybe they got it wrong. You weren't the $guyorgal who saved Bill in Hiroshima. Maybe it was someone else.	220	2	380	100

Perhaps I shouldn't even have looked forward to your stories to begin with. No offence, $sirormaam. I was just selfish to decide to come here. My parents were angry when they knew I joined the commandos.	200	2	440	100
I've been causing trouble here anyway. I must be distracting and that gotta be why you couldn't concentrate on your missions. Maybe I should just leave. I hope the President wouldn't be mad...	200	2	450	100
