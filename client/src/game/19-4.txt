Phase A, eh? Doesn't tell us much! But those signs indicate that it's a region in Russia near Riga!	160	10	300	100

Phase B! They're not regular soldiers, and those uniforms indicate they're East Berlin police... But they are lots more and better armed than the official figures reveal!	280	10	400	100

Sergei is dead, but the GRU can easily replace him! We've got to stymie their plot, but first we've got to find out what it's all about! Let's inform the President.	220	10	300	100

The atomic commandos were unleashed immediately! Assignment: to uncover and spike the plot at all costs...

In Berlin, Doc went into instant conference with a British intelligence man...
Ex-Nazi Von Zentner heads the East German police. We wondered why such an ambitious man accepted the job, but from what you've told me it's plenty big.	110	10	450	100
I've got to have a talk with this Von Zentner!	500	120	140	100
