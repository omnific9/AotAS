Before Bill could order a rescue attempt, the Antarcs sank into the frozen depths! Only one survivor remained...
You have won... your last victory! We are ready... thousands upon thousands...	110	30	140	100
Too bad we can't hear more, Bill... but he's just about finished!	410	10	140	100

Was this to be the instrument of conquest... this shining sphere bobbing near the sub that brought it down? Carefully, Dr. Blake and Bill inspected the strange craft...
It's powerful... and that thick insulation proves it was built to withstand terrific heat, Doc!	20	10	370	100
The jet seems to be activated by Gamma G radio waves... a force our scientists know hardly a thing about! Whoever these people are, Bill... they're a century ahead of us in technical know-how!	470	10	220	100

A moment later, another flaming crater opened in the Antarctic ice... and again the shock waves hit with the sudden fury of a typhoon!
Great guns... The sphere's going down!	110	40	130	100
Jump! We'll just about make it!	350	20	150	100

Now, the atomic commandos saw the meaning of the shock waves...
Bill... it's another formation of those Antarc craft! Those shock waves are formed every time a new squadron is launched!	240	10	300	100
Doc, take over the sub and try to locate their base... while I fly to Washington and tell 'em we're up against invasion!	370	210	280	100

Could the nation be warned in time? Could even our most modern defenses repel raiders like these? These were the questions... as the atomic plane roared toward our imperilled shores...

An emergency session in the white house...
All right, Commander Tyler... We'll assume those spheres are being launched right through the Antarctic ice! The question remains... where?	120	30	160	100
We'd need thousands of planes to discover the launching site! Meanwhile, the Antarcs seem able to send up unlimited numbers! And so far... the atomic sub hasn't found a way to stop them!	445	10	270	100

Have you any idea of what can be done, Bill?	80	10	120	100
We need an atomic shell that can devastate a huge area... something that will be used only in a show-down.	340	10	400	100
