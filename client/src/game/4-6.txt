And when it was all over...
The... the way they broke up that installation... like they hated atomic power! We couldn't do anythin'... they met our flame laughin' ... and then they used their own... an' we didn't laugh! There's that awful black ray of theirs that snakes out lookin' for its target too... Then blows it to Kingdom Come!	110	10	450	100

Swiftly to flight command... where Bill Tyler took over a squadron of fighting planes as you, his trusted friend, passed his word to the rest of the commandos. Then, broadcasting on a secret wave length...
We're going to need all the fire power we can get, Champ... Commandeer the Carolina and steam full speed for the position of the Presidential yacht which I give you! Doc, you and Tony race the repairs on the atomic sub... and then come blasting!	120	10	540	100
