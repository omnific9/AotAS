$connphrase Tony managed to approach you in a hurry.
Gotta say some praises to you, $getusername! When I still have the chance...	440	30	230	100
$getusername is a dedicated $manorwoman, Bill said. That's gotta be why you stuck to what you were assigned to do for such a long time.	440	30	230	100
What? You think I stayed for a long time too? I didn't even think of it that way. Everyday I wanted to run away, but I guess finally I stayed...	440	30	230	100
But you know I'm not staying here for world peace or the safety of America, don't you? Only for Jessica. Well, don't tell anyone else.	440	30	230	100

For Jessica, I must live, and so must you, for the rest of us!	440	30	230	100
You have come to understand Tony better. Something has changed inside of you. The next time you complete a mission, a piece of lost memory may come back to you.
