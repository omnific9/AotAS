On every side, the crushing deep -- but here was a passageway out of peril-fraught Atlantis.
Where are we going, Doc? When we come to the end of this oxygen jet -- then what?	70	40	210	100
We had to get out of there pronto, Bill -- or they'd have had us! If -- if we can get out of range of the Atlantean weapons, then I've got an Ace in the hole I can try!	380	30	320	100

But back in the locks --
Earthly fools -- they'll never escape that way! A path of oxygen -- and this torch --	120	20	520	100

Then what had been an avenue of escape suddenly became a flaming inferno -- as a fiery blast raced towards the atomic commandos!
Holy smoke! We're cooked -- and I do mean cooked!	350	50	320	100
Drowning is better than burning any day! Let's go!	180	350	200	100

All right, here it is! Dive out of the jet -- into the water!	60	50	300	100

And as the commandos obeyed, Doc played his trump card! A special radio sender, tuned to a secret channel --
Calling atomic submarine! Call atomic submarine! Submerge immediately and follow radio impulse!	280	50	400	100

And on the surface -- not far distant --
Calling atomic submarine! Call atomic submarine!	180	20	400	100
