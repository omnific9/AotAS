I know this is hardly the time, but I wonder if you have anything from eight years ago yet, when we were at Hiroshima. I believe to this day that you saved my life, and I owe you mine.	120	10	150	100
I'm sure you'll remember soon, once your training here is complete, in only a few days in real life... from the perspective of the person playing this game.	120	10	150	100
A special team designed these missions for you. And I'm confident that these missions will not only help you, but also help us all. I was told so anyway. But if you're ever in trouble, I'm here.	120	10	150	100
