$connphrase Dr. Blake caught your attention by a pat on the back.
You've been doing good work. I heard you've been doing well with your missions. It is impressive, I have to admit, to think that a few days ago you couldn't even remember who you are.	30	10	340	100

I had a mentor a few years ago, Dr. Oppenheimer, a rather famous scientist. But we had some disagreements. I wish in a few years I'd be proven right. I wish I could live a long time to see this happen.	180	10	320	100
He thought atomic energy could be used to make humans more powerful, to make us a better species... such a naive idealist, I say! If the President kept listening to him, the atomic sub wouldn't exist, and America would be no more.	180	10	320	100
