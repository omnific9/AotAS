$connphrase Champ took you to the gym he built in the atomic sub, a small room full of training equipment.
This is where I train, $boyorgirl. I train because I want to become stronger. What about you? Why did you join the commandos? Why did you agree to complete the mission assigned to you?	320	20	290	100

Back in the war, I had a really good friend. We lived in a small town. He was the sheriff, and I was deputy. We drank, took our families together to bonfire parties. Good times, until he was murdered by a spy.	150	20	370	100
When that happened, the happy times are gone. Gone, $getusername. The only thing that still appears in my head from time to time is the weeping widow of the man everyone respected, and when she said to me calmly: "Find them. Kill them all."	150	20	470	100
You uh... might not have thought about it. But if you don't have a reason for something, you ain't gonna do anything. Is there someone dear to you that you want to protect? Are you really ready for this? I mean, joing the atomic commandos and committing to your missions. Think about it.	150	20	470	100
