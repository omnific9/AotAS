Across the vast Pacific the atomic sub roared, and for the youngest of its crew, Jonnie Flint, there were numerous distractions...
Look! An old clipper ship! An' look at those crazy fish! Gee, I'd sure like to go for a dive!	150	30	150	10

The target was the merest speck on the floor of the greatest ocean of the world, but finally...
There it is. Cut the motors!	260	10	120	100
Its escape hatch is open, Bill. Can't blame the crew for trying to escape, even though it was impossible.	480	10	140	100

It called for steady hands and iron nerves, qualities for which Bill Tyler was justly famed. When the monstrous underwater killer was almost upon them...
Nasty-looking devil, isn't it?	80	10	180	100
Y-you can say that again! But it's through now!	300	10	100	100

Hey, Jonnie, wait! Let me go in first!	180	10	140	100

Too late! For no sooner had Jonnie's legs dropped into the submerged submarine, when suddenly hands reached up to pull him in!
What the... Help!	140	10	140	100
Hold on! I'm coming!	550	10	100	100
