A short while later aboard an American ship in the area...
It's an S.O.S., Captain! A Chinese sub seems to have developed engine trouble! They can't surface!	130	10	220	100
Proceed to their readings. There may be survivors!	390	10	120	100

The freighter stood by for hours, but...
Look, there's an oil slick coming to the surface! The poor devils must've drowned like rats! We'd better report this to the authorities.	250	10	200	100

Scant hours later, in the office of FBI's director...
Just in off the code wire, Chief! What do you think?	210	10	200	100
Plenty! Get Commander Tyler and the commandos here immediately!	490	10	180	100

The mighty gears of the U.S. government ground into action! Once again the atomic commandos were being briefed for a supremely important mission...
... And that's the dope we've got! We estimate the Chinese sub sunk here... in Four Mile Water, beyond ordinary diving possibilities.	80	10	240	100
And the atomic sub is the only mechanism in the world that can plunge into that depth!	490	10	180	100

Exactly! The papers aboard that sub are invaluable! With them we may be able to round up every red agent in the U.S.!	70	5	300	100
We all get the picture, Sir.	490	10	150	100

The FBI Chief turned the commandos over to government marine scientists, who put them in diving suits capable of withstanding tremendous pressures...
Under 20,000 feet of water the pressure is thousands of pounds per square inch! How does the garb feel, Commander?	80	20	250	100
Snug as a bug in a rug!	520	10	180	100

The dangerous task was heartily welcome to the commandos! 
Take her down, Doc!	180	20	100	100
Aye, aye, Bill!	470	20	100	100
SET	connphrase	As Bill was getting ready to dive into depths of water that no one dared to challenge,
