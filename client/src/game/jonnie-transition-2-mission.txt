$connphrase Jonnie came close to you and stared at you.
Ha... don't mind me, $sirormaam! I'm just curious about you and want to see exactly how special you are. Even though we've been together a while, I still don't know much about you!	120	20	480	100
I have an old buddy, a far relative of my family. I call him Old O. He was a great inventor an' he invented the telepathor too! Uh...	120	20	480	100

As Jonnie realized he just admitted to his false claim of inventing the telepathor, he blushed.
P... please don't tell Bill about it, or I'll get kicked out! Well... I didn't invent the telepathor. Old O invented it, and I took it, thinking I could use it to board the atomic sub.	220	5	370	100
An' I didn't care much about the sub, really. I just wanted to see you. Old O talked about you a lot, about how you were his last hope, and how your energy will lead us to victory.	220	5	370	100
See, it is true. When you accomplish your missions, I feel better too! An' I know Doc told me he'd invented all his little gadgets when you were doing a good job at your work. 	220	5	370	100
