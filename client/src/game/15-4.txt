The audio pickup was the latest electronic advancement, a device which listened in on conversation within a three-mile radius! Champ quickly pulled it from his knapsack...

But luck changes hands. Four Chinese Migs, raging wide in routine patrols, suddenly came upon the scene, facing Bill with the battle of his life!
Holy smoke! They've spotted me!	180	30	170	100

At the supersonic speed of modern aircraft, the planes met within five seconds! Suddenly the skies were alive with the clatter of machine guns and the roar of powerful motors!
