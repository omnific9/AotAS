$connphrase Tony stepped out of the shadows and surprised you.
Oh, did I scare you? I must apologize then, $getusername. But perhaps you should have paid more attention to things around here. You haven't finished your mission, so I heard.	440	30	240	100
When I was head of my own circus... well, there was that time... I had an assistant. He couldn't juggle, couldn't train the dogs, and couldn't cook. I kept him anyway. Do you know why?	440	30	240	100
He was blind, and blinded during one of the fire shows in my circus. He was like a brother to me, so I took care of him. What about you? Are you blind? You can clearly see this dialogue box, so I suppose not.	440	30	220	100
