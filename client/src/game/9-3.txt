An hour later, the Moonmen were surprised to see --
The Earth invader cometh!	280	100	180	100
He must not escape!	590	40	200	100

Dragged before the Moon King, Jonnie found his work cut out for him --
I -- I keep on tellin' you that we're your friends -- and they're your enemies! And I can prove it! If you and your warriors will only follow me, we'll show you a way into their walled city! You can take them by surprise -- the rest is up to you!	270	20	200	100
It shall go badly with thee if thou speakest not the truth! Lead and we follow!	510	10	200	100

And so a strange cavalcade set forth! In the lead, a boy piloting the mighty atomic sub turned rocket -- and behind him, a fighting fleet of the Moonmen's black space-ships!

Night still hid the fleet's arrival near the GRU city! While the Moonmen warriors took their prearranged positions, waiting tensely, Jonnie remained behind --
We can't do anything until I receive further instructions -- shh-hh! Here they come!	30	10	300	100
Jonnie! If you've returned with reinforcements according to time table, throw the panel switch marked radio contact -- and let the Moonmen attack!	450	10	280	100

As Jonnie threw the switch a tremendous explosion leveled the gates of the walled city! So that was what Bill had buried -- a super-powerful radio bomb controlled by a signal from the atom sub!

And through the gap left by the explosion -- the Moonmen charged!
Death to the invaders!	200	10	400	100
