Four more atomic commandos to go, including you! From the eyes of the attackers, the brain-rays darted, jolting you into a dazed dream. There was nothing you could do. Then, unimpeded, the giants turned loose a wave of wild sabotage! Objective, all atomic equipment! Savagely they attacked it ... yet, with a strange fear ...

We have finished here! Come! There is still much more to accomplish!	170	20	190	100

Doc, this sub's the central factor in America's defense! They've wrecked its atomic engine. Finish up the one in your workshop on the double, and you and Champ install it here! Tony and $getusername, it sounds as if the giants are working their way towards our biggest atomic plant at Baltimore! I'm depending on you to see that they don't wreck it!	80	5	670	100
