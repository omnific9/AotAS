One last chance! But as the destiny-laden moments passed, there didn't seem to be much that the atomic commandos could do to save a doomed world...

I overheard them saying they've got our kidnapped congress on a fortress island... must be that one out there!	280	10	180	100

That does it! I'll try my luck on the door now!	200	20	250	100

The locks on the cell door were multiple and intricate... but they, too, opened before the magic of his skilled fingers! Down a corridor they crept... only to find the route to freedom cut off!

The atomic commandos thought the way was clear now... only to find still another impediment to escape! It was Montilla, Captain of the Royal Guard, choosing this ill-fated moment for his entrance!
