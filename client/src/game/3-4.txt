It was a moment of pure horror -- as 300 tons of raging ferocity thundered towards two unconscious men! Bloody death was seconds away -- and what force was strong enough to stop it?

But in the outer chamber of the locks, a short distance away --
That's what I said! Turn that machine around -- fast!	150	30	200	100
I -- I don't get your idea, Doc -- but here goes!	420	30	270	100

Next moment, a surging blast -- as Doc bent the science of Atlantis to his own ends!
Oxygen under tremendous pressure -- red oxygen -- and it's done the job! You can fetch Bill and Tony now, Champ!	70	100	130	100

Hey, Doc -- a bunch of those creeps are coming up after us! How we ever gonna get out of this place?	140	30	160	100
Hmmm... a few alterations in the output system and I can step up that oxygen jet to cyclone power. Swivel this machine around again, Champ, then hold the door against all comers while I work!	390	30	340	100

Don't worry -- they're not -- getting in yet! But it's lucky you two snapped out of it!	100	10	300	100

This'll be the first time we've ever run under the ocean! Let's go!	210	20	370	100
Now the locks of Atlantis yawned wide -- and from them darted a blast of supercharged oxygen -- a titanic scarlet jet that snaked along the ocean bed, pushing the water back, back!
