In the atomic submarine, Jonnie was playing with the sonar systems and the periscope, as if he was coming back home from a long journey.
It's good to be finally back, ya know? I really missed you all. How have you been, $getusername? You still doing your training with Bill, I bet!	200	10	400	100
I feel that sometimes it makes you upset that you have to do things, but you get used to it, don't you?	200	10	400	100
When I was trapped in China, I sensed that the base we destroyed was just part of a bigger plot. Something much worse is coming for us.	200	10	400	100

I was told that atomic energy is the future of science, an' I really wanna become part of that future! But atomic energy can be used for so much more than destroying countries. Look at yourself for example, and what you can do! I heard on Carter Island, something strange happened to you, that a beam of light emitted from you.	120	20	480	100
Suddenly, Jonnie stopped talking, as if a thought was holding back his tongue.
Do you truly understand what you are, $getusername? I heard you saved Bill's life in the war, while you were both trapped in Japan, where one of the nuclear bombs struck... Can you still not remember? Most thought it a miracle, but a scientist does not believe in miracles. Think, $getusername.	120	20	480	100
You saved Bill's life in Japan, that is what everyone has been telling you, but in the chaos of a nuclear strike? How could that be? One would be burned to ashes or killed by radiation... You thought to yourself, as you looked as confused as Jonnie.
But you did not know: a great mystery would soon unfold, concerning you and the future of mankind. Come back tomorrow, and the story will continue!
