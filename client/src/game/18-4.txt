The deadly spheres would never range the skies again... but the Antarc empire itself remained intact!
That's their laval jet chamber, Jonnie, which uses molten rock from the center of the Earth to blast the spheres up through the ice!	200	10	380	100

In a headlong leap, Champ made the deck, and in the next instant, both Antarcs left it!

But now a howling mass of Antarcs bore down on the sub with molten streaks hissing from their flame-weapons! It was a heat drawn from the seething core of the Earth, and Bill knew that not even the secret alloy of the sub's hull could withstand it!
Inside! If we're ever going to fire the atomic supershell, it better be now!	430	20	250	100
