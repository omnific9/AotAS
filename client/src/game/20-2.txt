With great deference, they were shown through a huge war plant, the same shown on the captured microfilm...
We're very proud of those artillery shells with atomic warheads! But you know all about them... too well for me to go into, eh?	210	30	200	100
Oh yes, but do you know our plans... the overall plans, that is? 1,000 Rubles says you don't!	420	160	150	100

It will be the easiest 1,000 Rubles I've ever pocketed! Listen to me run through it! German east zone police touch off the August 15 D-Day invasion, followed by the massed might of the satellites!

Ha-ha! But short-range artillery shells can't destroy far-away America! How do we prevent them from destroying us?	130	10	210	100

Using his prodigious strength, Champ broke off a huge metal hook from an overhead derrick...
Keep back!	110	30	120	100
Toward the window, Champ! We can still make it!	410	20	250	100
