$connphrase Bill asked to speak to you. Something seemed to trouble him.
You've been part of the atomic commandos for quite a while now, but are you not getting used to the life underwater yet? Your missions haven't been getting done lately, and I'm concerned. 	140	20	500	100
Not just about you, $getusername. Ever since we put the team together, I noticed everybody's mood depended on if you completed your mission, to some degree. Champ was kinda mad and acted like a different person when you didn't do your job.	140	20	500	100

Dr. Blake got stuck at his new inventions, and even I would not know what to do sometimes. If the next mission comes up and I'm in such a state, I won't be sure to make the right decisions. And I like to think my decisions help us stay alive.	120	10	150	100

I'm not here to blame you, $getusername. I know you have your troubles. I believe you'll do well soon enough. I just want you to hurry up, because we haven't got much time.	120	10	150	100
Bill has revealed some of his dark side to you. Complete more missions to help Bill gain the courage and dedication that will help him battle life's hardship.
