By sheer force they were finally subdued, and brought before the installation's commander...
Welcome, atomic commandos, we were expecting you! Messages from East Berlin told me you'd been there, and knowing your reputation, I was sure you'd pay us a visit...	120	50	200	100
Yeah, the surprise was on us... flying saucers were the last thing we expected to see!	440	30	100	100
Indeed. I'm betting that you regret not having taken a sample of the Mercury technology when you destroyed their base on Earth. The great leaders of the Soviet Union have seen farther.	120	50	200	100

And you Americans refuse to believe the reports about these crafts! We've had them scouting your country for months! But tomorrow, August 15, our D-Day, swarms of them will be over your country... each containing H-Bombs!	210	20	300	100
Why, you...	470	250	100	100

Take it easy, Bill! There's nothing we can do!	520	10	180	100

August 15 dawned clear and bright, and aboard the atomic submarine, young Jonnie was intensely worried...
The commandos should have reported by radio long ago! Something's happened... but what? If they're alive, I can get through to them with the telepathor...	140	40	300	100

Moments later, in the far-off cell...
I'm going nuts! We can't just stand by helplessly while...	110	20	200	100
Wait, hold it! I think I... Yes! Jonnie's using the telepathor!	450	10	140	100

With communication established, it took only brief moments for the situation to be made clear...
Look, I understand the whole setup, and I've got a plan! I don't have time to explain it, but you've got to break out! Then climb... as high as you can! Climb for your lives!	60	10	200	100
