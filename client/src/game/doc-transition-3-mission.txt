$connphrase Edwin sat by your side, nervous and excited.
I got to tell you something, $getusername. When we first met, I told you you looked familiar, didn't I? I think I finally remember who you are...	30	10	340	100
Perhaps what you're doing is affecting me. I mean... perhaps my memories came back to me because you continue to accomplish your missions... Does this sound strange to you?	30	10	340	100

Back in World War II, when we first understood atomic energy, we conducted several experiments.	470	10	280	100
Of course, one of these experiments would lead to the atomic bombs, but there were others that yielded results...	470	10	280	100

And one day, they took a young $manorwoman into the lab. Only Dr. Oppenheimer and an elite scientist group were allowed in the room. I wasn't good enough. So I only heard rumors of what happened. 	180	10	320	100
They say they injected the $manorwoman with... energy... atomic energy went into $hisorher blood veins, muscles and genes, everything. They created a $manorwoman by combining human and atomic technology.	180	10	320	100
And you look like that $manorwoman, except it's impossible, because if you were $himorher, you've never aged.	180	10	320	100
And then, Dr. Blake seemed to calm down. He laid his hands open and shrugged.

You didin't expect these, did you? Sorry... I was just scared that you could be different from us... a different kind of creature.	30	10	340	100
