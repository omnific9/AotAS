$connphrase Champ took you to the gym he built on the atomic sub.
They call me the Champ, the strongest man of America. Well, maybe they're right, but it takes only practice to get where I am. You just keep accomplishing your missions, and you'll get there too.	320	20	290	100

And then, Champ put his dumbbells aside. He looked at you in the eyes. Inside his, you saw regret.
I used to be a weak man. I've always worked out, but I was weak in my mind. In the war, a friend of mine was killed by a German spy. I just couldn't live after that... until...	150	20	370	100
Until I shot the spy dead by myself, fifteen times. Even after the war ended, I wanted to revenge my old pal. Washington gave me a chance to go out and stop them evil men from killing my friends and my countrymen.	150	20	370	100
But I couldn't forget all these years, $getusername, that the man begged before I killed him. The German spy... he begged to live, and I just couldn't resist the urge to revenge my pal...	150	20	370	100
I'm a murderer, ain't I? They say you lost your memories. How does that feel? I wish I'd lost my memories, and wouldn't have to live through those old days again and again...	150	20	370	100

And so Champ put his face in his palms for a long time. Then he took an early leave from the gym and headed back to the operation room.
