$connphrase Dr. Blake approached you in a rush.
I have to say, seeing you continue to impress us with your mission performance, I'm starting to wonder a lot... wonder if I was right...	30	10	340	100

I have been so stubborn, insisting that I was right and refusing to listen to others. And here you are, if you are who I think you are, an atomic creation that is not meant to destroy but to grow and inspire.	180	10	320	100
In Dr. Oppenheimer's writings, he mentioned that he created an atomic shield that can grant life rather than death, and give protection rather than destruction. I think that might be you.	180	10	320	100
At any rate, I'm glad we met.	180	10	320	100

You now understand Edwin better. Continue to complete your missions. A piece of lost memory may come to you next time.
