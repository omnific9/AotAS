A hundred miles from the south pole, Champ picked up Bill's flash...
Nothing new, Bill... but I'm out here in a jet glider scouting two hours for the sub's anchorage! Keep contact... might be another formation coming along any time now!	160	20	250	100
FRAME	-400	-160	1.20
That crater isn't mere accident! There's a chance it marks where a meteor hit... or it could be what I'm looking for!	220	10	350	100

Then... with a sudden violence that came close to tearing the plane apart...
Another shock wave... directly below!	440	70	150	100
FRAME	-30	-920	1.2
In the next split second, it happened... The fiery column roaring up from the ice in a molten rush... carrying a dozen Antarc spheres with it... rising red-hot from the seething crater!
FRAME	-750	-940	1.20
No plane ever designed could elude the velocity of the flaming spheres! There was a splintering impact of metal against metal... as two of the spheres and the atomic plane met head-on!

As Bill plummeted clear, one soul-chilling glance told him that he was not falling alone... that something bright and pointed was spiralling with him toward the Antarctic ice...
The atomic shell!	420	20	120	100
FRAME	-590	-1500	1.20
The most terrible weapon of the atomic age fell in a plunge that threatened destruction for everything within a radius of a thousand miles!
