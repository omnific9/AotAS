SET	connphrase	While the commandos waited in prison, hoping that Jonnie's appeal would work this time, 
Carefully they scaled the walls! It didn't take long to find the building they sought --
This is the place -- I can read enough Russian to make that out! Says something about H-Bomb launching controls. Think you can get that lock opened, Tony?	100	10	400	100
Just watch me!	580	120	120	100

There wasn't a lock in the world that could resist Tony's subtle mastery -- and this one was no exception! But as the door swung open --

Inexorably, the moments ticked past towards the zero hour! And the only ones who could save America were prisoners!
It -- it looks bad! There's nothing --	130	10	100	100

At that moment -- aboard the atom sub rocket --
Jonnie -- can you hear me? You know how to pilot the ship now -- and you'll find the location of the Moonmen's city in the log! Get there at top speed -- barge right in and tell them --	470	10	240	100
