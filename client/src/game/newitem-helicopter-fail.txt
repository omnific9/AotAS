Gentlemen, I'd like to show our counselor around the research chamber.	100	100	300	100
Right before the mission starts, Doc asks you to follow him in checking the equipment boarded on the submarine. You follow him to the research chamber and see sophisticated charts of the arsenal in this submarine all powered by atomic energy.
