$connphrase Tony ran over to you.
This is hardly the time to talk, $getusername, I know, but I have to ask you something!	440	30	230	100
You've been doing impressive work lately. How do you stand doing all those boring missions? I would not have done it for a single day!	440	30	230	100
Remember I told you... that I was really scared? Well, the truth is I kept running all my life... The first time was being caught stealing a loaf of bread, because I was really hungry...	440	30	230	100
When I was working in a circus, and the army came looking for recruits for the war, I ran again. I didn't wanna die. I kept running away from my beatings and difficult things, but then something changed.	440	30	230	100

Tony showed you a locket he kept hidden in the deepest pocket of the greatest escape artist of America. In the locket was a picture of a woman.
I met Jessica, you heard Tony say, and that was when I thought to myself that this escaping was all too much.

Tony only showed the picture to you briefly before he took it away in the heat of this mission, carefully pushing it down his inner pocket again.
When Washington came calling, I was gonna run away again, but I finally decided to come look at what they want me for. All for Jessica.	440	30	230	100
Oh, looks like I've been talking too much. I always do. And looks like I'm talking myself into something. I think I somehow could understand why you feel so responsible for your missions.	440	30	230	100
