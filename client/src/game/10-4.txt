SET	connphrase	Just as the commandos were in the midst of gaining balance from a mysterious metal fish attack, 
Now, finally, the frenzied words penetrated Jonnie's dazed consciousness, brought him from his bunk in incredulous horror!
The professor and I are the only ones left alive! But they're battering the door now! For Heaven's sake... get help to us before it's too late!	260	10	250	100
Get up -- don't you hear? Please wake up! I - I can't make 'em even stir!	130	270	170	100

They'll have to get me before they can lay a hand on you -- and I -- I'm hoping the atomic commandos get here before that happens!	230	10	300	100

He shouted something about the Marine guards being killed, and him and the professor being locked up in the lab with the guys crashing down the door! That -- that's the last I heard!	240	10	280	100

Look, Bill -- what do you make of those creatures?	40	160	110	100

That's funny -- usually they turn tail when they spot the sub -- but those are coming for us almost as if they had a purpose, Doc!	550	210	170	100

Yes, these fish had a purpose! Attracted by magnetism, they smashed into the hull of the atomic sub, exploding with all of the terrible force of the super-explosive they carried!

Oof!	120	10	100	100
