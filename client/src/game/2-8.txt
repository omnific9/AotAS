Yes, the atomic commandos were free now -- free to meet the deadly onslaught of things that weren't men! And courage couldn't avail against numbers!
Oof! These critters are poison!	60	20	120	100
Don't give in, folks! Fight for your lives!	350	10	220	100

They're -- powerful -- and too many for us!	40	10	220	100

Well, woddeya know! I bumped into some sort of new-fangled weapon -- and turned it on!	70	30	300	100
Yeeowww!	350	340	120	100
FRAME	-380	-850	1.2
Don't be bashful! It's for all of you!	200	20	120	100
You've got 'em, Tony! Quick -- turn that gadget on the tubes these creeps come from -- so no more of 'em can hatch out!	370	30	190	100

The commandos didn't know it was a short-lived victory. How could you dream of the weird science that followed your every move -- the enemy eyes that spied upon you even then?
They'll search out the palace hoping to discover the details of our plot! But I'll be ready for them!	510	50	210	100

I guess that's the place we're looking for! Hope nobody sees us -- we've got to make this a surprise!	50	30	400	100
Our guide here wasn't any too willing! We'll tie him up and hide him!	520	30	120	100
It happened just as the leader of the strange beings had foreseen --

-- Even to his "capture"!
Looks like you're the leader around here! It's obvious that you creeps are from some other planet, and you've got a well-organized plot going. Do you talk or do we take you apart?	130	30	450	100
Ah, yes -- there's a lot you earthlings must learn --	120	200	150	100
